This project was created to make education easier. I know lots of people myself who decided not to do programming because of how hard it is to find needed information. This project is the solution to this and many more problems you have on your way to becoming a programmer.

Being a programmer is much more interesting than you can imagine. In this blog, our team will make your learning experience much more interesting. This doesn't mean that this resource won't be useful for skilled programmers. We are sharing different resources, tools with the community to make the developing process easier. Additionally, in this blog, we will be collecting solutions to many different problems we had on our way.

### Discord Sever

Discord server is dedicated to helping each other and making education an exciting thing. On this server, you will find a huge amount of useful books, videos, and guides about different programming languages. Each programming language has its own thread where people can ask for help, or help others.
